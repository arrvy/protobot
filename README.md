# Protobot â€“ Selasar Game Jam 2025

**Protobot** is a 2D top-down puzzle game prototype developed in **7 days** during the **Selasar Game Jam 2025**.
The theme was **"One Time Use"**, and we explored this idea through **disposable robot characters** â€” each robot can only be used once before it breaks.

## ðŸ§  Game Concept

You play as a young engineer trying to reclaim stolen robots using imperfect prototypes.
Each robot has **one unique ability** â€” pushing boxes, activating switches, crossing traps, and more.
However, **once a robot breaks, itâ€™s gone for good**, so every move must be carefully planned.

### Core Mechanics

* Disposable robots with unique abilities
* Strategic, tile-based puzzle levels
* Environmental interactions (buttons, traps, doors)
* One-time-use mechanic that challenges player foresight
